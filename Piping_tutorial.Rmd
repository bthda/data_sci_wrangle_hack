#Piping in R
## From Chapter 18 R for Data Science (Grolemund, Wickham)

###Pipes are used to combine a sequence of multiple operations

The pipe, %>%, comes from the magrittr package by Stefan Milton Bache, but is loaded with the tidyverse

###Much of the time it is used to make the sequence easier to read

```{r}
data <- Batting

new_data <- select(data, AB, H, HR)

#or with pipe
new_data2 <- data %>% select(AB, H, HR)

head(new_data == new_data2)

#we can continue to add operations
new_data2 <- data %>% select(AB, H, HR) %>% mutate(AVG = H/AB)

head(new_data2)
```

##The authors warn to use pipes only when they are the best tool.
###Do not use pipes when:
1. You have more than 10 operations. This becomes confusing and difficult to debug
2. Multiple inputs or outputs--piping is linear
